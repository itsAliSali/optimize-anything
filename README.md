# optimize-anything

# TODO
- [x] implement the obj funtion as a python program
- [x] use scipy to optimize.
- [x] parallelize the program --> scipy does not support evaluating all the population in the objective function. So I'm switching to PyMoo.
- [x] implement PSO in PyMoo
- [x] add timeout mechanism to external function call.
- [x] read optimizaiton params from config file.
- [ ] unittest ? 
- [ ] add requirement.txt file
- [ ] write an instruction on how to run the code (Update readme file).
